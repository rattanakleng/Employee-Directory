## Description
The app lets the user display all employees, sort list ascendence or descendent, and search for an employee by the first name. The app was built with React, and fetch data [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/). 

## User Story
As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
